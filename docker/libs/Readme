Libyang:
	install path: /usr/local/

libssh:
	install path: /usr/local/
	dependency: OpenSSL, installed with version 1.1.1

libnetconf2:
	install path: /usr/local/
	/* old */installed only with SSH. TLS is disabled with  -DENABLE_TLS=OFF while cmake.
	EDIT: installed without flags because netopeer2 had problems during build 

sysrepo:
	install path: /usr/local/

netopeer2: 
	instalation fails becasue of tls. First suposition is that it's because 
	libnetconf is installed with tls dissabled.
	EDIT: works after re-installing libnetconf2 without flags.

	Note: installed libcurl4-openssl-dev to enable url's. If not, warning apears while
	installing netopeer2 without it.
